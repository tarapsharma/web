- *Buddha*
  1. “Peace comes from within.  Do not seek it without.”
  2. “Every morning we are born again. What we do today is what matters most.”
  3. “If you truly loved yourself, you could never hurt another.”
  4. “Nothing can harm you as much as your own thoughts unguarded.”
  5. “There is no path to happiness: happiness is the path.”
- *S. N. Goenka*
  1. "Discover real peace and harmony within yourself, and naturally this will overflow to benefit others."
 
  2. "Rather than converting people from one organised religion to another organised religion, we should try to convert people from misery to happiness, from bondage to liberation and from cruelty to compassion."
  
-  *Sayagyi U Ba Khin*
  1. “Just as the light of a candle has the power to dispel darkness in a room, so also the light developed in one man can help dispel darkness in several others.”
  2. "Dhamma eradicates suffering and gives happiness. Who gives this happiness? It is not the Buddha but the Dhamma, the knowledge of anicca within the body, which gives this happiness. That is why you must meditate and be aware of anicca continually."
- *Gandhi*
  1. "You must be the change you wish to see in the world."
  2. "The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong."
- *Einstein*
  1. "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."
  2. "A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new."
- *Kalam*
    1. “Dream is not that which you see while sleeping it is something that does not let you sleep.”
    2. “You cannot change your FUTURE, you can change your HABITS. And surely your HABITS will change your FUTURE”
- *Edison*
    1. “There are no rules here -- we're trying to accomplish something.”
    2. “Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.”

* Conclusion

Going from "we could solve this with ML!" to an actually-viable product is often[fn:3] a
bumpy road. Incorporating human feedback into an automated system is a key tool to help
ease this transition. I don't have any easy recommendations here; whether and how you
should incorporate human input into your particular product is highly dependent on the
product and the market in which it is situated.

But you should consider it. I've seen human augmentation assist ML companies at every
stage of growth, from pre-seed to post-IPO. It is a tool that, in my opinion, every
technology strategist should have in their toolkit.

* Footnotes
[fn:4] [[https://www.cio.com/article/274740/outsourcing-sla-definitions-and-solutions.html][Service-level agreements]], which "defines the level of service expected by a
customer from a supplier"; in this case, the "level of service" refers to the latency of
a system.

[fn:3] Read: always.

[fn:2] Even if a model is more accurate than the human-only alternative, explainability
can still be an important psychological issue for customers. Consider a driverless car
that has accident rates 1/10th those of an average driver; however, when it does crash,
it does so seemingly at random. Public perception and adoption of such a product would
(I predict) be poor, since when we are in such critical situations, we often rely on
explanations to feel safe and in-control. Note that this may be less of an issue for
internal-use models, where adoption can be decreed by management, and not driven by user
perception.

[fn:1] I'm not saying this is what YouTube actually does. This is just an example.
