# About Me

width="50%" hspace="20" align="right">

I am passionate mathematician and a Ph.D. student in Mathematics at Texas A&M University (TAMU). With a deep love for numbers, structures, and their applications, my journey in mathematics has been driven by curiosity and the desire to contribute to the world of academia and beyond.

I've worked with [unicorn start-ups][5] and [large publicly traded corporations][6],
building models, establishing codebases, and providing mathematical expertise to
developers. My mother tongue is Nepali, but I also speak English and Hindi. I have
experience working with the full Python data stack, and also have experience writing
Spark jobs in Scala and Java.

I have a bachelors degree in Mathematics from Sikkim govt. College Tadong, and MSc in Mathematics from Sikkim University, Gangtok where I did
[my thesis][2] on The Stone-Cech compactification βX. My thesis focused on the Stone-Čech compactification 
βX, exploring its applications in topology, functional analysis, measure theory, combinatorics, set theory, logic, and beyond. The work highlights its role in extending spaces, functions, and structures to a compact and universal framework."
After spending some time pursuing other interests,[^fnote2] I began working on my
Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at Texas A&M University (TAMU)For more details on all that, check out [my portfolio](/portfolio/), or
take a look at [my resume][4].

I live at the [EcoVillage in Ithaca](https://ecovillageithaca.org/). Most recently, I
worked remotely as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at [Abnormal
Security](https://abnormalsecurity.com/).

[^fnote2]: After graduating from Reed, I spent some time living at
	[Great Vow Zen Monastery][3], where we followed a daily schedule of work and
	meditation.
